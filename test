# Final Portfolio Reflection

Before I took this class, I hadn't really given much thought to the relationship between technology and culture, in part because I didn't even think there was one. Now however, the situation is quite different. Not only do I believe that there is a strong relationship between the two but I also find myself pondering on the effects multiple different technologies have had on culture and the role that culture has played in shaping technology. With that being said, it might come as a surprise then that my favorite assignment wasn't the second one, the Curation Project, but actually the third one, the Design Thinking Project. A big reason for that is because I was able to talk about one of my all time favorite video-games, one that I feel very passionate about. But also because I got to look at it from a different perspective and learn new things about it, which only made me appreciate the game more.
